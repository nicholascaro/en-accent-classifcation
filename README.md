## Assignments
####  Our project consists of four Jupyter notebooks, each building upon the work done in the previous notebook, with the exception of our first notebook, ```preprocessing.ipynb``` which serves as the starting point. We have consolidated all of our work in the final notebook, ```evaluation-and-analysis.py``` which contains the complete analysis and evaluation of our project. To provide clarity and structure, we have listed each notebook along with its corresponding .py file by the assignment.
